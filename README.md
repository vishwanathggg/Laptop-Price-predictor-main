# Laptop-Price-predictor
Laptop price predictor is a machine learning project that predicts the price of a laptop based on its specifications such as screen size, processor speed, graphics card, memory, and storage capacity.
The key feature of this project is the use of feature engineering techniques to extract new features from the existing ones, resulting in a more accurate prediction of laptop prices.
The random forest regression model proved to be the most effective for predicting laptop prices.
